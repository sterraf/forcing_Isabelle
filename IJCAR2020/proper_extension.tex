\section{Example of proper extension}

Even when the axioms of $\ZFC$ are proved in the generic extension,
one can't claim that the magic of forcing has taken place unless one
is able to provide some \emph{proper} extension with the \emph{same
ordinals}. After all, one is assuming from starters a model $M$ of $\ZFC$,
and in some trivial cases $M[G]$ might end up to be exactly $M$; this
is where \emph{proper} enters the stage. But, for instance, in the
presence of large cardinals, a model $M'\supsetneq M$ might be an
end-extension of $M$ ---this is were we ask the two models to have the
same ordinals, the same \emph{height}. 

Two short theory files contains the relevant
results. \texttt{Ordinals\_In\_MG.thy} shows, using the closure of $M$
under ranks, that $M$ and $M[G]$ share the same ordinals (actually,
ranks of elements of $M[G]$ are bounded by the ranks of their names in
$M$):

\end{isabelle}

\texttt{Non\_Constructible.thy} contains the first example of a poset
that interprets the locale
\isatt{forcing{\isacharunderscore}notion}. It is the set of all binary
lists with the partial order given by  ``\isatt{xs} is an extension of
\isatt{ys}.''
