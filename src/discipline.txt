In our work described in IJCAR 2020 we dealt with concepts that are absolute,
meaning that the relativized version (wrt the ground model) coincide with the
concept on the universe. For absolute concepts one can reason about concepts
in the ground model using results about the universe; in contrast, there are
other concepts that are not absolute, for instance, cardinal. 

\<guillemotleft>The discipline\<guillemotright> aims to fill the lack of a method to reason about relativized
concepts using results that are valid in the universe. Instead of trying to 
re-develop several results already present in the Constructible library, we aim
to port them to a relativized context and try to reuse as much as possible Paulson's
mechanization.

The discipline relies on noticing that if a relativized concept (wrt a class M) 
is univalent and defined, then one can refer to *the* unique element in the class
satisfying the relational property that defines the concept. 

The discipline (for unary concepts):
1.[is_foo] Given a concept "foo" relativize it in "is_foo", if necessary one has to apply 
the discipline to every other concept on which "foo" depends. 
2. Prove univalence and definedness for "is_foo":
  a.[is_foo_uniqueness] \<forall>[M] a b. is_foo(M,r,a) \<and> is_foo(M,r,b) \<rightarrow> a = b
  b.[is_foo_witness] \<exists>[M] a. is_foo(M,r,a)
3. [foo_rel] Define the relative concept "foo_rel"
  definition
    foo_rel :: "i \<Rightarrow> i" where
    "foo_rel(r) \<equiv> THE d. M(d) \<and> is_foo(M,r,d)"
4. [foo_rel_closed] Prove that M is closed under foo_rel
5. [foo_rel_iff] Prove that the element defined by foo_rel satisfies is_foo.


TODO:
- Characterization of foo_rel (as in def_Pow_rel and Pow_rel_char)
- Benefits of using this approach
- Relativized concept according to the discipline coincides with the
  absolut one if one instantiate M to the whole universe (M \<equiv> \<lambda>_ . True)
