Forcing in Isabelle/ZF
======= == ===========

The source theory files are located in the 'src' directory.
The directory 'html' contains a browseable and cross-linked
version of the sources.

------------------------------------------------------------

Running the session with jEdit
======= === ======= ==== =====

The session can be run using the standard Isabelle IDE by
executing

    isabelle jedit -d . Forcing_Main.thy

in the 'src' directory. 

------------------------------------------------------------

Building the session
======== === =======

To build the session, change to 'src'
and run

    make build

To obtain also an HTML version of the sources, do

    make html

To make a tar, run

    make tar

------------------------------------------------------------

System requirements
====== ============

The session requires Isabelle2020 to be installed, and the
tool wrapper 'isabelle' should be on the PATH env var.

At least 8G of RAM would be desirable. If memory 
requirements are not met, there is a chance that the 
building process stalls indefinitely at some point, without
failing.
