Tidying up sources for release
==============================

- *New* Revise consistency of source comments in Definitions_Main.thy.
- Put all the development according to the style guides.
- Remove "Try0" imports.
- Remove auxiliary commands (find_theorems, try, try0).
- Remove diagnostic commands (term, thm --- keep this last one in
  Definitions_Main.thy!)
- Clean up warnings (as of this commit, unavoidable in 3 theories)


Unaddressed issues in Transitive_Models
=======================================

- Enable more "mem_model" patterns for iff_sats.


General Tasks
=============

- Rename absoluteness results (subject to change):

* foo_rel_abs : foo(x) = foo_rel(M,x)
* is_foo_iff: foo_rel(M,x) = y ↔ is_foo(M,x,y)
* foo_abs : foo(x)=y ↔ is_foo(M,x,y)

- Search sources for "FIXME", "NOTE", "MOVE (THIS)", "TODO", and do
  that.

- Search for code duplication. Examples:
    Forcing_Data.Transset_M
  vs
    Interface.Transset_intf

- Revise naming conventions of results (esp. for the next section;
  check style_guide.txt).

- Move general results proved in some context to the definition
  of the context.

- Revise locale assumptions of separation and replacement. They
  should involve relativized concepts. We are not clear if we need
  them to be even relationalized (which would make them closer to the
  internalized versions). This discussion surely depends on is_iff
  theorems.


ZF-Constructible
================

- rename "L_axioms.range_type" to "L_axioms.range_fm_type" (clash with
  ZF.func).
  In general, uniformize notation (e.g. typed_function_type).
  Too many of them!

- Add resuls like fst_closed? (cf. General tasks)

- Bad behaviour of abbreviation
  ¬(sats(·)) ---> satisfies(·)`_≠ 1
  because of definition of ≠.

- In strong_replacementD, use "is_Replace(M,A,P,Y)" in the conclusion.
  Same for separationD. Then use this for the "_witness" theorems for
  strong replacement and (separation?) instances.

- (Revise) Refactorize Formula and Relative to include the following
  three lemmas (see Least.thy):
  lemmas basic_fm_simps = sats_subset_fm' sats_transset_fm' sats_ordinal_fm'


Assorted To-Dos
===============

- Have instances of val_check in forcing_data, G_generic (discharging
  assumptions). Add it to the simpset?

- Port the whole AC theory.

- Decide if we can put Lambda_Replacement earlier and define
  M_Pi_assumptions depending on M_replacement.
