We will gladly incorporate this changes into a revised version.

We knew of Han and van Doorn when we were somewhat advanced in our
project and decided to continue because of the differences: a
different meta-theory and a different approach to forcing. We think
that this paper is interesting per se (we can agree that the arXiv
paper is a bit premature) as it establish a ground on which to do
forcing arguments.

We would like to point that the main result may seem straightforward
thanks to the more substantial contribution of the paper: the
definition of the forces function and the proof of the forcing
theorems. Han & van Doorn [CPP 2020] hint that the formalization of
forcing using the ctm and in a set theoretical foundations is more
intricate than via the Boolean-valued models on type-theory.
