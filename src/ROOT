    The Independence of the Continuum Hypothesis

    We redeveloped our formalization of forcing in the set theory framework of
    Isabelle/ZF. Under the assumption of the existence of a countable 
    transitive model of ZFC, we construct proper generic extensions 
    that satisfy the Continuum Hypothesis and its negation.
