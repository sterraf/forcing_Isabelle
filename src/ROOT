    Relative Consistency of the Axiom of Choice:
    Inner Models, Absoluteness and Consistency Proofs.

    Gödel's proof of the relative consistency of the axiom of choice is
    mechanized using Isabelle/ZF. The proof builds upon a previous
    mechanization of the reflection theorem (see
    http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/lcp/papers/Sets/reflection.pdf). The heavy
    reliance on metatheory in the original proof makes the formalization
    unusually long, and not entirely satisfactory: two parts of the proof do
    not fit together. It seems impossible to solve these problems without
    formalizing the metatheory. However, the present development follows a
    standard textbook, Kunen's Set Theory, and could support the formalization
    of further material from that book. It also serves as an example of what to
    expect when deep mathematics is formalized.

    A paper describing this development is

    Formalization of Forcing in Isabelle/ZF

    We formalize the theory of forcing in the set theory framework of 
    Isabelle/ZF. Under the assumption of the existence of a countable 
    transitive model of ZFC, we construct a proper generic extension 
    and show that the latter also satisfies ZFC.
