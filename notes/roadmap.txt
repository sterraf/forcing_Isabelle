Milestones to reach ¬CH
=======================

0. Find a way to automate synthesis of separation and strong
   replacement instances (required for 1-4 below, and perhaps also for
   item 5).

1. Finish porting CardinalArith.

2. Define a discipline for wfrec to Port ZF-Constructible.Normal
   (mainly because of ℵ) and Delta_System_Lemma.Cofinality.

3. Finish Delta_System_Lemma: port the existing development and
   complete the remaining parts now in relativized way.

4. Develop Cohen_Posets in the relativized style, prove the ccc for
   them using Delta_System_Lemma.

5. Finish the formalization of Kunen's IV.3:

   5a. Formalize IV.3.3: given M ⊆ N transitive models, if regulars
       are absolute betwee M and N, then cardinals are absolute. (No
       forcing needed for this, but Cofinality for regular).

   5b. Prove IV.3.4 and then IV.3.7.
