We knew of Han and van Doorn when we were somewhat advanced in our
project and decided to continue because of the differences: 

 1) a weaker meta-theory (Han & van Doorn [CPP 2020] hint that the
 formalization of forcing in set theoretical foundations is practically
 impossible); and

 2) an approach to forcing (ctm) used in a important fraction of the
 literature.

We agree that the remaining work towards the independence of CH will
require one more paper. Notice that, in fact, Han & van Doorn have two
papers (ITP2019, CPP2020) detailing the full account of their
formalization. (As a side note, our second manuscript on the subject
is not published.)

This is a misstatement of our achievements. Our "Main Theorem" may
seem straightforward thanks to the more substantial contribution of
the paper: the definition of the forcing relation and the proof of the
forcing theorems. The Main Theorem is a succinct way to demonstrate
the forcing machinery, since there is no other way to produce
extensions of ctms.

We would like to point out that we proved the fundamental theorems of
forcing, which are the main tools to work with the forcing relation.
