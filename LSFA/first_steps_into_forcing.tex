\section{Future work}
\begin{itemize}
\item Develop an interface between Paulson's relativization results
  and countable models $M$ of $\ZFC$. This will show
  that every such $M$ is closed under well-founded recursion and, in
  particular, that contains names for each of its
  elements. Consequently, $M\sbq M[G]$.
\item Prove that the basic axioms of $\ZFC$ hold in the generic
  extension. 
\item After prototyping the forcing relation, prove the Axiom Scheme
  of Separation (the first that needs to use the machinery of forcing
  nontrivially).
\end{itemize}
