First and foremost, we would like to thank the referees for their
careful reading and detailed criticism. We are indeed greatly
benefited by their evaluation.

We first address some issues that appeared in more than one
review. Our choice of Isabelle/ZF as framework was simply based on the
need to decrease the overhead of the formalization process. Indeed,
the main drawback of this choice is that we cannot perform inductive
arguments on "external" formulas (i.e., Isabelle terms of type
o). This is the reason why we are using internalized formulas.

There is are some questions in common on parameters of Separation, but
those are answered below.

Finally, we were a bit preoccupied by a comment made in one of the
reviews. Reviewer 3 states that ours is not the first formalization of
separation. We are extremely eager to know about this, would they
provide a reference for such a strong claim?

Not really, since ∈ is defined in the "ambient" Isabelle type i, and
one can restrict it to any set.

We actually did, but that wasn't part of this submission. We are sorry
for the imprecision

Yes, indeed.

Actually, it is well known [Levy, SchiSchli] that there are
axiomatizations of ZF without any parameters. We have chosen an
axiomatization using at most one parameter in both Separation and
Replacement. In this sense, we can prove that M[G] satisfies the "same
amount of Separation" that M is assumed to satisfy.

This is a mistake. Forcing was not formalized by Paulson.

There is a mistake in this assertion. The only axiom that has been
published before (at least by us) was Pairing.

We agree that internalized formulas are not needed per se; however in
Isabelle/ZF internalized formulas are the only representation of
formulas that are syntactically manipulable. We welcome the suggestion
of extending Isabelle/ZF with a new inductive type "f" for formulas,
this would, however, change the meta-theory (in contrast with Agda, Coq,
or even Isabelle/HOL there is no support in Isabelle/ZF for introducing
inductive types).

Nevertheless, we are *not* using the theory of constructible sets for
our formalization, only the absoluteness results (which are
prerequisites for both theories).

Though it is a fact that Con(ZF) does not imply the existence of ctms
of ZF, finitary consistency proofs can be obtained through the ctm
approach, since one only needs that the ctm M satisfy only a finite
fragment of ZF at a time (and such an M can be obtained by a standard
reflection argument). For a reference, check [Kunen, IV.5].

Isabelle/ZF does not define a type of natural numbers (we just have i
and o). "In general" would mean an universal quantification over the
set nat::i.
