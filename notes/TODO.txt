FIXMEs
======

- L. 26 of `Lambda_Replacement`:
This can be combined with separation_ball to remove the need of the
extra assumption in lam_replacement_Collect.

Miguel, 2022-02-28: I think I've tried and I couldn't.


General Tasks
=============

- Rename absoluteness results (subject to change):

* foo_rel_abs : foo(x) = foo_rel(M,x)
* is_foo_iff: foo_rel(M,x) = y ↔ is_foo(M,x,y)
* foo_abs : foo(x)=y ↔ is_foo(M,x,y)

- Streamline the use of arity, especially for higher order constructs
  (is_wfrec_fm and the like). Minimize use of fm_definitions.

- Search sources for "FIXME", "FIX ME", "NOTE", "MOVE (THIS)", "TODO",
  "TO DO", and do that.

- Search for code duplication. Examples:
    Forcing_Data.Transset_M
  vs
    Interface.Transset_intf

- Relativization results / synthesis discipline should be rewritten
  for a general class M in the appropriate locales (and not only for
  ##M).

- Check for duplicate names of results

- Revise naming conventions of results (esp. for the next section;
  check style_guide.txt).

- Move general results proved in some context to the definition
  of the context.

Tidying up sources for release
==============================

- Put all the development according to the style guides.
- Remove "Try0" imports.
- Remove auxiliary commands (find_theorems, try, try0).
- Remove diagnostic commands (term, thm --- keep this last one in
  Definitions_Main.thy!)
- Clean up warnings (today: Kappa_Closed)

Porting
=======

- Revise the locale structure of ported theories.


ZF-Constructible
================

- rename "L_axioms.range_type" to "L_axioms.range_fm_type" (clash with
  ZF.func).
  In general, uniformize notation (e.g. typed_function_type).
  Too many of them!

- Add resuls like fst_closed? (cf. General tasks)

- Bad behaviour of abbreviation
  ¬(sats(·)) ---> satisfies(·)`_≠ 1
  because of definition of ≠.

- In strong_replacementD, use "is_Replace(M,A,P,Y)" in the conclusion.
  Same for separationD. Then use this for the "_witness" theorems for
  strong replacement and (separation?) instances.


Assorted To-Dos
===============

- Add comments about Definitions_Main in root.tex.

- Check if "minimum" should be in Forcing_Main.

- Have instances of valcheck in forcing_data, G_generic (discharging
  assumptions). Add it to the simpset?

- Add to simpset? Simplified versions of class version theorems
  instantiated for a set model, because the original versions are not
  effective enough. Example:

  apply_closed: (##M)(?f) ⟹ (##M)(?a) ⟹ (##M)(?f ` ?a)
  apply_closed[simplified]: ?f ∈ M ⟹ ?a ∈ M ⟹ ?f ` ?a ∈ M

- Named theorems for arities.

- Discipline for Vfrom_abs and Vfrom_closed

- Relocate material on antichains (in Forcing_Notions?) and results on
  range (both now in Cardinal_Preservation).

- Check which results proved for nat can be generalized to Ord.

- Once changes from finite_repl_rebased are applied to master, move
  earlier the sublocale interpretation of M_trans from Choice_Axiom to
  Union_Axiom.

- Discuss the need to have internalized formulas in *_Relative
  theories (meant for the Transitive_Models session). At least two
  approaches: Discipline fully applied to each new concept vs having
  all fms in one place.

- fst_abs, snd_abs, minimum_closed, and others out of sharp_simps to
  avoid warnings in the previous commit b3551d9; but now we have to
  cite them. Find out why the warnings were triggered in first place.
