Forcing in Isabelle/ZF
======= == ===========

The source theory files are located in two directories:

    * 'Constructible' contains our version of 
    Paulson's constructibility library;

    * 'src' contains the material directly concerning 
    forcing.

The directory 'html' contains a browseable and cross-linked
version of the sources.

------------------------------------------------------------

Running the session with jEdit
======= === ======= ==== =====

The session can be run using the standard Isabelle IDE by
executing

    isabelle jedit -d . Forcing_Main.thy

in the 'src' directory. After doing this, the setting

    jedit_logic = "ZF-Constructible-Trans"

will be added to your local 

    ~/.isabelle/Isabelle2019/etc/preferences

file; so you should adjust this variable to your logic of
preference afterwards.


------------------------------------------------------------

Building the session
======== === =======

To build the session, change to 'src'
and run

    make build

To obtain also an HTML version of the sources, do

    make html

To make a tar, run

    make tar

------------------------------------------------------------

System requirements
====== ============

The session requires Isabelle2019 to be installed, and the
tool wrapper 'isabelle' should be on the PATH env var.

At least 8G of RAM would be desirable. To run the session
using the IDE this seems to be enough, but for builds have 
only been successfully tested with 16G RAM. The ML process 
is ran with a minimum heap size of 5.5G. If memory 
requirements are not met, there is a chance that the 
building process stalls indefinitely at some point, without
failing.
