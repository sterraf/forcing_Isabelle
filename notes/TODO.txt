Tidying up sources for release
==============================

- *New* Revise consistency of source comments in Definitions_Main.thy.
- Put all the development according to the style guides.
- Remove "Try0" imports.
- Remove auxiliary commands (find_theorems, try, try0).
- Remove diagnostic commands (term, thm --- keep this last one in
  Definitions_Main.thy!)
- Clean up warnings (as of this commit, unavoidable in 3 theories)


FIXMEs
======

- L. 26 of `Lambda_Replacement`:
This can be combined with separation_ball to remove the need of the
extra assumption in lam_replacement_Collect.

Miguel, 2022-02-28: I think I've tried and I couldn't.


Unaddressed issues in Transitive_Models
=======================================

- Enable more "mem_model" patterns for iff_sats.


General Tasks
=============

- Rename absoluteness results (subject to change):

* foo_rel_abs : foo(x) = foo_rel(M,x)
* is_foo_iff: foo_rel(M,x) = y ↔ is_foo(M,x,y)
* foo_abs : foo(x)=y ↔ is_foo(M,x,y)

- Search sources for "FIXME", "FIX ME", "NOTE", "MOVE (THIS)", "TODO",
  "TO DO", and do that.

- Search for code duplication. Examples:
    Forcing_Data.Transset_M
  vs
    Interface.Transset_intf

- Relativization results / synthesis discipline should be rewritten
  for a general class M in the appropriate locales (and not only for
  ##M).

- Check for duplicate names of results

- Revise naming conventions of results (esp. for the next section;
  check style_guide.txt).

- Move general results proved in some context to the definition
  of the context.

- Revise locale assumptions of separation and replacement. They
  should involve relativized concepts. We are not clear if we need
  them to be even relationalized (which would make them closer to the
  internalized versions). This discussion surely depends on is_iff
  theorems.


ZF-Constructible
================

- rename "L_axioms.range_type" to "L_axioms.range_fm_type" (clash with
  ZF.func).
  In general, uniformize notation (e.g. typed_function_type).
  Too many of them!

- Add resuls like fst_closed? (cf. General tasks)

- Bad behaviour of abbreviation
  ¬(sats(·)) ---> satisfies(·)`_≠ 1
  because of definition of ≠.

- In strong_replacementD, use "is_Replace(M,A,P,Y)" in the conclusion.
  Same for separationD. Then use this for the "_witness" theorems for
  strong replacement and (separation?) instances.


Assorted To-Dos
===============

- Have instances of valcheck in forcing_data, G_generic (discharging
  assumptions). Add it to the simpset?
