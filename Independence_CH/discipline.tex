\section{Discipline for relativization}
\label{sec:discipline-relativization}

As we said in Sec.~\ref{sec:relat-vers-non-absol}, in order to force
$\CH$ and its negation we depended on having relativized versions of
cardinals, Alephs, etc. It was clear for us that our efforts would be
more efficient if we set up a discipline for relativizing sets (terms
of type $\tyi$) and predicates/relations (terms of type $\tyo$).

Paulson only had, for each set, the relational version. It seemed
clearer to us to have a functional version of the relativized concept.
Going back to our example in \ref{sec:tools-relativization}, for the
concept $\isatt{cardinal}::\tyi \fun \tyi$ we want its relative
version
$\isatt{cardinal{\uscore}rel}::(\tyi \fun \tyo) \fun \tyi \fun\tyi$
and the relational version of the latter
$\isatt{is{\uscore}cardinal}::(\tyi \fun \tyo) \fun \tyi \fun \tyi
\fun \tyo$.

Our first attempt of defining a discipline was inspired by
mathematical considerations: if we might prove that
$\isatt{is{\uscore}cardinal}$ is functional and also prove the
existence of a witness $\isatt{c}$ such that $\isatt{M(c)}$ and
$\isatt{is{\uscore}cardinal(M,x,c)}$ then
$\isatt{cardinal{\uscore}rel(M,x)}$ can be obtained by the operator of
definite descriptions.

Soon we realized that resorting to definite descriptions was needed
only for the most primitive concepts. In fact, once we have a
relativized concept, we can use it to define other relativizations.
For instance, $\isatt{cardinal{\uscore}rel}$ depends on having
relative versions of $\isatt{bij}$. Instead of relationalizing
$\isatt{bij}$ to get $\isatt{is{\uscore}bij}$ and then prove
uniqueness and existence of a witness, we define
$\isatt{bij{\uscore}rel}$ using $\isatt{inj{\uscore}rel}$ and
$\isatt{surj{\uscore}rel}$.
