\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

One of our main goals was to provide a \emph{proof document}, which
can hopefully be read by mathematicians/set-theorists.

Where did we fail on this?
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  The definition of forces is too codish.
\item
  Proving instances of axiom schemes.
\end{enumerate}
