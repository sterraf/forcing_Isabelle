\section{The generic extension}
Forcing is a technique to extend countable transitive models of
$\ZFC$. This process is guaranteed to preserve the $\ZFC$
axioms but allows to fine-tune what other first order properties the
extension will have. The first, both historically and in importance,
application of forcing was the proof that $\AC$ and $\CH$ were not
derivable from $\ZFC$; this was done by Cohen in its seminal work
\cite{Cohen-CH-PNAS}.
