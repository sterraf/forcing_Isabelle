First and foremost, we would like to thank the referees for their
careful reading and detailed criticism. We are indeed greatly
benefited by their evaluation.

----------------------- REVIEW 1 ---------------------

> Moreover, I would have expected at least a bit of discussion on the
  benefits/drawbacks of choosing Isabelle/ZF over other possible
  frameworks (Coq, Mizar, Isabelle/HOL, HOL Light, ... and the
  corresponding underlying logics).

Insistir que el overhead era tremendo si no usábamos Isabelle/ZF.

Hay que decir que ∈ es el mismo para todos los modelos (el externo).

    to the chosen framework (Isabelle/ZF) or is it more general?

Aclarar

> - "it is also possible", "it can be shown" -> if you did it, say it
    as such, otherwise I am not sure that this is informative or
    useful (but I might be missing something)

Decir que lo hicimos pero no es parte de esta submission > - Union is
absolute for any transitive class -> is it well-known ?

YES!

----------------------- REVIEW 2 ---------------------

> Summary: This paper presents a formalization in Isabelle of some
> axioms of Set theory of a generic extension of a model of Set theory

> been shown to hold in a generic extension is Separation. The paper
> starts by presenting very briefly Isabelle, axioms of Set theory,
> mentioning the representation of first-order formulas as sets done
> by Paulson and discuss their presentation of renaming of
> formulas. Then the authors explain briefly the generic extension of
> a model of Set theory using forcing, some modifications they have

> authors explain how to prove the “easy axioms” first. Then they

> the generic extension providing the fundamental lemmas
> holds. Finally, they conclude by discussing how the main missing
> axiom, i.e. Replacement, could be proven.

> Questions to the authors: “We are only able to prove that the

Hay que decir que no (de hecho con 2 parámetros estamos haciendo
todo), pero tendría que sentarme un rato a confirmar de nuevo esto.

----------------------- REVIEW 3 ---------------------

> My biggest complaint is that this work does not seem to provide the
  kind of fundamental contributions to logic that LICS is looking
  for. There is no new mathematics here, and this isn't even the first
  formalization of separation.

WTF!? Acá hay que preguntar cuál es la otra.

----------------------- REVIEW 4 ---------------------

> The more important point is that the "increment" presented in this
> paper is (IMO) too little for being published in a top conference
> such as LICS. Indeed, the paper only deals with the soundness of

> Infinity has been published before,

Acá la pifió bárbaro. Después repite esto que todos los axiomas
fáciles están en otro paper. ¿Cómo llegó a tener esa impresión?

> The other point deals with the formalization choices of the authors,

Raro esto. Kunen tiene una sección específica sobre cómo se puede
hacer esto.

Bueno, se ve que no le quedó claro que esto no se puede hacer. Hay que
insistir.

Acá otro pifie, pero es por algo que no aclaramos nosotros: nuestra
presentación no depende de constructibilidad per se, sino de
relativización y absolutez, que es de hecho un prerrequisito para
ambas teorías.

Bueno, hacer todo desde cero es una complicación innecesaria para
nosotros (!).

Todo está pasando dentro de "i", así que no es relevante esta
observación. Hay que discutirlo un poco más.  > > p. 2, last paragraph

No sólo eso. Se está olvidando de los resultados de absolutez.  > >

Tranquilate un poco... Esto también es irrelevante, porque sólo
necesitamos un ctm de un fragmento suficientemente grande de ZFC (cosa
que el Teorema de Reflexión nos da).

Ídem... Sólo necesitamos un fragmento finito de esto, como lo explica
Kunen en el libro nuevo.  > > This is why other approaches have been

Me gusta más el enfoque de los ctm para trabajar en general (y
off-the-record, es el que más entiendo de todos), y además tratamos de
seguir lo más posible una sola referencia (i.e. Kunen) para darle
cohesión al trabajo. La discusión sobre la conveniencia de usar el
enfoque de los modelos a valores booleanos es más interesante, pero
creo que otra vez nos pone en el brete de tener que reimplementar
varias cosas.

Aclarar esto.

Tendría que ver esto, no estoy seguro ya mismo. Este tipo entiende,
sí, pero hay gente que entiende bien un enfoque y no el otro (bueno, a
mí me pasa un poco pero al revés de este muchacho).
