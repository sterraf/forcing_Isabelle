\begin{abstract} 
  We lay the ground for an Isabelle/ZF formalization of Cohen's technique of
  \emph{forcing}. We formalize the definition of forcing notions as
  preorders with top, dense subsets, and generic filters. We formalize
  a version of the principle of Dependent Choices and using it
  we prove the Rasiowa-Sikorski lemma on the existence of generic filters.
  
  Given a transitive set $M$, we define its generic extension $M[G]$,
  the canonical names for elements of $M$, and finally show that if $M$
  satisfies the axiom of pairing, then $M[G]$ also does.
