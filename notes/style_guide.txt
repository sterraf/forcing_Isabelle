Style Guide for Forcing
=======================

The following guidelines intend to maximize readability of the code,
taking into account

  1) trying to obtain a “mathematical proof” style and reading
     experience;
  2) the folding enforced by the PIDE jEdit;
  3) ease to find lemmas by name.

We adhere to most of the suggestions offered in the
http://proofcraft.org/ site by Gerwin Klein, though many rules here
are stricter than his.


General Concepts
================

The main idea is that the look and feel of the produced proof document
mimics as much as possible the way you would write down a proof in
paper. 

A formalized proof will never look exactly like that, in part
because of the abundance of “bureaucracy” that accompanies any
formalization, and the multitude of lemmas that one must manage to be
able to achieve any reasonable goal. Neither long lines with commands
cluttering up help much to the non expert.

Thus, we aim to make proof structure very clear, highlighting facts
locally obtained avoiding quoted results in the forefront, and using
simple (automatic) proof commands as much as possible.


Structuring Theories
====================

Example of header (indented with 2 spaces for demonstration purposes):

  theory Cardinal_Preservation
    imports
      Cardinal_AC_Relative
      Forcing_Main

  begin
  
  [contents]

A blank line show follow every `begin` command (the one before is
optional), and every `end` command should be preceded by a blank
line. For contexts, the syntax is similar:

  context M_trivial
  begin

  [contents]

  end (* M_trivial *)

A closing `end` must be followed by a comment stating which context is
being closed. (This is not needed for the `end` closing a theory.)
This requires special attention due to context (name) changes.


Statements and Proof style
==========================

Naming Conventions
------------------

Lemmas are labelled using `under_score_names` and those names will
spell, as far as possible, the “main subterm” that appears in the
statement of the lemma, using the ASCII names of the relevant
operators. For example,

  lemma (in forcing_data) surj_nat_GenExt:
    "∃f. f ∈ surj(nat,M[G])"

Here, `M[G]` is the notation set up for the term `GenExt`.

In some cases, some (terms in) notable assumptions might be included
in the name, and are separated from the conclusion using `_imp_` (for
"imply"):

  lemma well_ord_surj_imp_lepoll:
    assumes "well_ord(A,r)" "h ∈ surj(A,B)"
    shows "B ≲ A"

All results must have a name.


Statements
----------

Statements in long format `assumes`...`shows` are preferred, unless
the proof follows immediately (thus saving one `using assms`). In
stating assumptions, the most significant ones are to be put first. In
particular, various typing assumptions go last. Example:

  lemma forces_below_filter:
    assumes "M[G], map(val(G),env) ⊨ φ" "p ∈ G"
      "arity(φ) ≤ length(env)" "φ ∈ formula" "env ∈ list(M)"
    shows "∃q∈G. q ≼ p ∧ q ⊩ φ env"

There is no space between the lemma name and the colon. The statement
(with its assumptions) should start in a new line unless everything
fits on the first one.


Proofs
------

Methods given as arguments to `proof` are to be kept to a minimum,
only when the refined goal is what to be expected a human prover would
take as an equivalent statement with no effort--- most of the times,
the `standard` (default) initial method or slight variations are
enough for this. Also, terminal proof methods should not take more
than two lines.

The general structure of proof steps should follow the next pattern

  [chaining NEWLINE]
  {`have`,`show`,`obtain` vars `where`} facts NEWLINE
    [using *lemmas already proved*] [unfolding *lemmas*]
    `by` terminal proof

where

  chaining = `from` local facts
  	     `also`
  	     `also` `from` local facts
	     `finally`
	     `moreover`
	     `moreover` `from` local facts
	     `ultimately`
  	     `then`
	     `with` local facts

Newlines are mandatory where indicated. Due to jEdit folding, `obtain`
and `where` must be on the same line. If facts are too long to fit in
a line, leave less relevant information (like typing) to the end.

  1) New code must be written in Isar. 
  2) Try to keep labelled facts and cross-references inside proofs to
     a minimum. This can be achieved by judiciously using the
     `moreover`...`finally` commands.
