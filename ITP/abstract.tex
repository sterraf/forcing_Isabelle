  We mechanize, in the proof assistant Isabelle, a proof of the
  axiom-scheme of Separation in generic extensions of models of set
  theory by using the fundamental theorems of forcing.  We also
  formalize the satisfaction of the axioms of Extensionality,
  Foundation, Union, and Powerset. The axiom of Infinity is likewise
  treated, under additional assumptions on the ground model.  In order
  to achieve these goals, we extended Paulson's library on
  constructibility with renaming of variables for internalized
  formulas, improved results on definitions by recursion on
  well-founded relations, and sharpened hypotheses in his development
  of relativization and absoluteness.
