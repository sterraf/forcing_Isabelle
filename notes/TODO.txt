General Tasks
=============

- Search sources for "FIXME", "FIX ME", "NOTE", "MOVE (THIS)", "TODO",
  "TO DO", and do that.

- Search for code duplication. Examples:
    Forcing_Data.Transset_M
  vs
    Interface.Transset_intf

- Relativization results / synthesis discipline should be rewritten
  for a general class M in the appropriate locales (and not only for
  ##M).

- Check for duplicate names of results, for example:
    Forcing_Theorems.forcing_data.GenExtD
  vs
    Names.forcing_data.GenExtD.

- Revise naming conventions of results (esp. for the next section;
  check style_guide.txt).

- Move general results proved in some context to the definition
  of the context.

  For instance:
  * upairM singletonM Rep_simp from Names.thy to Forcing_Data.thy



Tidying up sources for release
==============================

- Put all the development according to the style guides.
- Remove auxiliary commands (find_theorems, try, try0).
- Remove diagnostic commands (term, thm --- keep this last one in
  Definitions_Main.thy!)


Porting
=======

- Revise the locale structure of ported theories.


ZF-Constructible
================

- rename "separation_closed" to "Collect_closed".
- rename "obase_exists" to "obase_closed".
- rename "L_axioms.range_type" to "L_axioms.range_fm_type" (clash with
  ZF.func). In general, uniformize notation
  (e.g. typed_function_type).
- "pred_set_abs" in ZF-Constructible.Wellorderings holds in M_trans.
- ZF-Constructible.Rank
  - Text comments referring to "oB", "om": Should that be "obase",
    "omap"?
  - Put some name to the result after well_ord_abs.
- Two nameless lemmas in ZF-Constructible.Formula are declared [simp]
  Name them "sats_Member_iff" and "sats_Equal_iff".
- Add resuls like fst_closed? (cf. General tasks)
- Bad behaviour of abbreviation
  ¬(sats(·)) ---> satisfies(·)`_≠ 1
  because of definition of ≠.
- rename "nonempty" to "M_zero" or "zero_into_M".
- In strong_replacementD, use "is_Replace(M,A,P,Y)" in the conclusion.
  Same for separationD. Then use this for the "_witness" theorems for
  strong replacement and (separation?) instances.


ZF
==

- Erase superfluous hypotheses from the conclusion of
  InfCard_rel_csquare_eq.

- Eliminate alternative definition names:
  image_def ---> Image_def
  the_def ---> THE_def

- Rename lepoll_imp_Card_le to lepoll_imp_cardinal_le and
  well_ord_lepoll_imp_Card_le to well_ord_lepoll_imp_cardinal_le.


Assorted To-Dos
===============

- Add comments about Definitions_Main in root.tex.

- Prettyprint for elements of "formula".

- Check if "minimum" should be in Forcing_Main.

- Have instances of valcheck in forcing_data, G_generic (discharging
  assumptions). Add it to the simpset?

- Add to simpset? Simplified versions of class version theorems
  instantiated for a set model, because the original versions are not
  effective enough. Example:

  apply_closed: (##M)(?f) ⟹ (##M)(?a) ⟹ (##M)(?f ` ?a)
  apply_closed[simplified]: ?f ∈ M ⟹ ?a ∈ M ⟹ ?f ` ?a ∈ M

- Named theorems for arities.

- Discipline for Vfrom_abs and Vfrom_closed

- Relocate material on antichains (in Forcing_Notions?) and results on
  range (both now in Cardinal_Preservation).
