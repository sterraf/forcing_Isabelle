General Tasks
=============

- Search sources for "FIXME", "FIX ME", "NOTE", "MOVE (THIS)", "TODO",
  "TO DO", and do that.


Tidying up sources for release
==============================

- Put all the development according to the style guides.
- Remove auxiliary commands (find_theorems, try, try0).
- Remove diagnostic commands (term, thm --- keep this last one in
  Definitions_Main.thy!)


Porting
=======

- Revise the locale structure of ported theories.


ZF-Constructible
================

- rename "L_axioms.range_type" to "L_axioms.range_fm_type" (clash with
  ZF.func).
- "pred_set_abs" in ZF-Constructible.Wellorderings holds in M_trans.
- ZF-Constructible.Rank
  - Text comments referring to "oB", "om": Should that be "obase",
    "omap"?
  - Put some name to the result after well_ord_abs.
- Add resuls like fst_closed? (cf. General tasks)


ZF
==

- Erase superfluous hypotheses from the conclusion of
  InfCard_rel_csquare_eq.


Assorted To-Dos
===============

- Add comments about Definitions_Main in root.tex.
- Prettyprint for elements of "formula".
- Check if "minimum" should be in Forcing_Main.
