\section{Forcing}
Given a ctm $M$, and an $M$-generic filter $G\sbq\PP$, the Forcing
Theorems relate satisfaction of a formula 
$\phi$ in the generic extension $M[G]$ to the satisfaction of another
formula $\phi'$ in $M$. The map $\phi\mapsto\phi'$ is defined by
recursion on 
the structure of $\phi$. The fact that this map works (in particular,
in order to show that $M[G]\models\ZFC$), we must use the fact that
$M\models\ZFC$. Since we can only assert the latter using internalized
formulas, the aformentioned map will be defined as a function from the
set \formula{} into itself. 

Up to this point, the main reason for working with internalized
versions is that  it is not possible to do recursion with formulas of
type $\tyo$ (i.e., the formulas in the first-order logic of
Isabelle/ZF).

We will now make more precise the definition of the map
$\phi\mapsto\phi'$ and how it relates satisfaction in $M$ to that in
$M[G]$. Actually, if the formula $\phi$ has $n$ free variables,
$\phi'$ will have $n+4$ free variables, where the first four account
for the forcing notion and a particular condition. If
$\phi=\phi(x_1,\dots,x_n)$, the standard notation for $\phi'$ is
\[
p\forces_{\PP,\leq,\1}^* \phi(t_1,\dots,t_n).
\]
Here, $\PP,\leq,\1,$ and $p\in\PP$ are the extra parameters. 
%% For the
%% time being, we just consider $\tau_1,\dots,\tau_n$ to be ordinary
%% variables. 
Given $\quine\phi\in\formula$, we will write this  in
Isabelle/ZF by using  
\[
\forceisa(\quine\phi,\PP,\leq,\1,p)
\]
Afterwards, the \emph{forcing relation} $\forces$ is defined by
relativizing/interpreting $\forces^*$ in a ctm $M$, for fixed
$\lb\PP,\leq,\1\rb\in M$:
\[
p\forces \phi(t_1,\dots,t_n) \defi 
\bigl(p\forces_{\PP,\leq,\1}^* \phi(t_1,\dots,t_n)\bigr)^M\!.
\]
