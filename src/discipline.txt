In our work described in IJCAR 2020 we dealt with concepts that are absolute,
meaning that the relativized version (wrt the ground model) coincide with the
concept on the universe. For absolute concepts one can reason about concepts
in the ground model using results about the universe; in contrast, there are
other concepts that are not absolute, for instance, cardinal. 

\<guillemotleft>The discipline\<guillemotright> aims to fill the lack of a method to reason about relativized
concepts using results that are valid in the universe. Instead of trying to 
re-develop several results already present in the ZF library, we aim
to port them to a relativized context and try to reuse as much as possible Paulson's
mechanization.

The discipline relies on noticing that if a relativized concept (wrt a class M) 
is univalent and defined, then one can refer to *the* unique element in the class
satisfying the relational property that defines the concept. 

The discipline (for unary concepts):
1.[is_foo] Given a concept "foo" relativize it in "is_foo", if necessary one has to apply 
the discipline to every other concept on which "foo" depends. 
2. Prove univalence and definedness for "is_foo":
  a.[is_foo_uniqueness] \<forall>[M] a b. is_foo(M,r,a) \<and> is_foo(M,r,b) \<rightarrow> a = b
  b.[is_foo_witness] \<exists>[M] a. is_foo(M,r,a)
3. [foo_rel] Define the relative concept "foo_rel"
  definition
    foo_rel :: "i \<Rightarrow> i" where
    "foo_rel(r) \<equiv> THE d. M(d) \<and> is_foo(M,r,d)"
4. [foo_rel_closed] Prove that M is closed under foo_rel; add this to
   the simpset and as an intro rule.
5. [foo_rel_iff] Prove that the element defined by foo_rel satisfies is_foo.
6. [def_foo_rel] Prove a lemma characterising "foo_rel" in terms of the other
  _rel terms. This is fundamental to port seamlessly the original proofs.
7. [foo_rel_char] (when it applies) State and prove the relationship
   between the relative concept and the original absolute one; for instance:
    lemma inj_rel_char:
      assumes "M(A)" "M(B)"
      shows "inj_rel(A,B) = {f \<in> inj(A,B). M(f)}"


Notice that for absolute concepts, the absoluteness theorem "foo_abs"
corresponds to the "foo_rel_iff" theorem. This observation enables us
to understand the benefit of pursuing the discipline: if the concept isn't 
absolute then one ends up with relativized concepts described by formulas,
the composition of such concepts is more and more unwieldly. In contrast
with the discipline one has a concept as in every day mathematics that
permits to define new relativized concepts by composing other relativized
concepts. Moreover the proofs for the unrestricted concept can be easily
adapted to its relativized counterpart.



TODO:
- Description for the case of predicates foo :: "... => o", where "foo_rel"
  is defined fully relationally (as if it were "is_foo"), and then then next
  theorem to prove is "def_foo_rel" (and  "foo_rel_char", if applies).
- Relativized concept according to the discipline coincides with the
  absolute one if one instantiate M to the whole universe (M \<equiv> \<lambda>_ . True)
- Identify from the above description the possibilities to automate things.
- Add to the Discipline the proof of implications/inequalities between relative
  Pi_1 and Sigma_1 concepts and absolute versions:

  eqpoll ==> eqpoll_rel
  |_|r â‰¤ |_|
