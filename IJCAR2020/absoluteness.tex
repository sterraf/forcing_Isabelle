\section{Relativization,  absoluteness, and the axioms}
\label{sec:relat-absol}

The concepts of relativization and absoluteness (due to Gödel, in his
proof of the relative consistency of $\AC$ \cite{godel-L}) 
are both
prerrequisites and powerful tools in working with transitive
models. A \emph{class} is simply a predicate $C(x)$ with at least one
free variable $x$.
The \emph{relativization} $\phi^C(\bx)$ of a set-theoretic
definition
$\phi$ (of a relation such
as ``$x$ is a subset of $y$'' or of a function like $y=\P(x)$) to
a class $C$ is obtained by restricting all of its quantifiers to $C$.

\[
x \sbq^C y \equiv \forall z.\ C(z) \longrightarrow (z\in x
\longrightarrow z\in y)
\]

The new formula $\phi^C(\bx)$ corresponds to what is obtained by defining
the concept ``inside'' $C$. In fact, for a class corresponding to a
set $c$ (i.e.\ $C(x) \defi x \in c$), the relativization $\phi^C$ of a 
sentence $\phi$ is equivalent to the satisfaction of $\phi$ in the
first-order model $\lb c, \in\rb$.

It turns out that many concepts mean the
same after relativization to a nonempty transitive class $C$; formally
\[
\forall\bx.\ C(\bx) \longrightarrow (\phi^C(\bx) \longleftrightarrow
\phi(\bx))
\]
When this is the case, we say that the relation defined by $\phi$ is
\emph{absolute for transitive models}. (The absoluteness of functions
moreover requires that
the relativized definition also behaves functionally over $C$.) As
examples, the relation of inclusion $\subseteq$ ---and actually, any
relation defined by a formula (equivalent to one) using only bounded
quantifiers 
$(\forall x\in y)$ and $(\exists x\in y)$--- is absolute for
transitive models. On the contrary, this is not the case with the powerset
operation.

A benefit of the work with transitive models is that many 
concepts concepts (pairs, unions, and fundamentally ordinals) are
uniform across the universe \isatt{i}, a ctm (of an adequate fragment of
$\ZF$) $M$ and any of its extensions $M[G]$

A part of this project is to refactorize Paulson's formalization
\cite{paulson_2003} of Gödel's \cite{godel-L}. The main objective is
to maximize applicability of the relativization machinery by adjusting
the hypothesis of a greater part of it early development. Paulson's
architecture had only in mind the consistency of $\ZFC$, but, for
instance, in order to apply it in the development of forcing, too much
is assumed at the beginning; more seriously, some assumptions can't be
regarded as ``first-order'' (v.g. the Replacement Scheme).

The version of \isatt{ZF-Constructible} we present weakens the
assumptions of many absoluteness theorems to that
of a nonempty transitive class; also there are some stronger results
such as the relativization of powersets.

Apart from the axiom schemes, the $\ZFC$ 
axioms are stated as predicates on classes (that is,
of type \isatt{(i{\isasymRightarrow}o){\isasymRightarrow}o}); some
of them were already defined by Paulson, and this formulation allows a
better interaction with \isatt{ZF-Constructible}. 
The axioms of Pairing, Union, Foundation,
Extensionality, and Infinity are relativizations of the respective
traditional 
first-order sentences to the class argument. For the Axiom of Choice
we selected a version best suited for the work with transitive
models: the relativization of a sentence stating that for every $x$
there is surjection from an ordinal onto $x$. Finally, Separation and
Replacement were treated separately to effectively obtain first-order
versions. It is to be noted that predicates in Isabelle/ZF are akin to
second order variables and thus do not correspond to first-order
formulas; in particular, there is no induction principle for functions
of type \isatt{i{\isasymRightarrow}o}. For that reason, Separation and
Replacement predicate \emph{on the satisfaction} of a formula $\phi$.
With respect to our previous \cite{2019arXiv190103313G}, we lifted the
arity restriction for the parameter $\phi$ on these schemes,
streamlining various proofs as an immediate benefit and avoiding the
need for tupling.

Once this class versions of the axioms are set up, it is not hard to
apply our synthesis method to obtain their internal, first-order
counterparts.\footnote{It should be noted that our method for
  synthetic definition requires that the schematic goal had a
  particular format where the only unbound schematic variable occurs
  as an (open) formula whose satisfaction is equivalent to some
  relativized predicate.}
