FIXMEs
======

- L. 26 of `Lambda_Replacement`:
This can be combined with separation_ball to remove the need of the
extra assumption in lam_replacement_Collect.

Miguel, 2022-02-28: I think I've tried and I couldn't.


Unaddressed issues in Transitive_Models
=======================================

- Duplication of
    declare [[syntax_ambiguity_warning = false]]
  in Discipline_Base and Discipline_Cardinal.

- Enable more "mem_model" patterns for iff_sats.

- Many pred(pred(pred(...))) in Arities


General Tasks
=============

- Rename absoluteness results (subject to change):

* foo_rel_abs : foo(x) = foo_rel(M,x)
* is_foo_iff: foo_rel(M,x) = y ↔ is_foo(M,x,y)
* foo_abs : foo(x)=y ↔ is_foo(M,x,y)

- Search sources for "FIXME", "FIX ME", "NOTE", "MOVE (THIS)", "TODO",
  "TO DO", and do that.

- Search for code duplication. Examples:
    Forcing_Data.Transset_M
  vs
    Interface.Transset_intf

- Relativization results / synthesis discipline should be rewritten
  for a general class M in the appropriate locales (and not only for
  ##M).

- Check for duplicate names of results

- Revise naming conventions of results (esp. for the next section;
  check style_guide.txt).

- Move general results proved in some context to the definition
  of the context.


Tidying up sources for release
==============================

- Put all the development according to the style guides.
- Remove "Try0" imports.
- Remove auxiliary commands (find_theorems, try, try0).
- Remove diagnostic commands (term, thm --- keep this last one in
  Definitions_Main.thy!)
- Clean up warnings (today: Not_CH, CH)


ZF-Constructible
================

- rename "L_axioms.range_type" to "L_axioms.range_fm_type" (clash with
  ZF.func).
  In general, uniformize notation (e.g. typed_function_type).
  Too many of them!

- Add resuls like fst_closed? (cf. General tasks)

- Bad behaviour of abbreviation
  ¬(sats(·)) ---> satisfies(·)`_≠ 1
  because of definition of ≠.

- In strong_replacementD, use "is_Replace(M,A,P,Y)" in the conclusion.
  Same for separationD. Then use this for the "_witness" theorems for
  strong replacement and (separation?) instances.


Assorted To-Dos
===============

- Add comments about Definitions_Main in root.tex.

- Have instances of valcheck in forcing_data, G_generic (discharging
  assumptions). Add it to the simpset?

- Add to simpset? Simplified versions of class version theorems
  instantiated for a set model, because the original versions are not
  effective enough. Example:

  apply_closed: (##M)(?f) ⟹ (##M)(?a) ⟹ (##M)(?f ` ?a)
  apply_closed[simplified]: ?f ∈ M ⟹ ?a ∈ M ⟹ ?f ` ?a ∈ M

- Discipline for Vfrom_abs and Vfrom_closed

- Relocate material on antichains (in Forcing_Notions?) and results on
  range (both now in Cardinal_Preservation).
