We will gladly incorporate this changes into a revised version.

We believe that the previous assertions are not entirely accurate. As
it is clear from our introduction, our second manuscript on the
subject is not published (and it won't be) in any venue other than the
arXiv. (As a side note, Han & van Doorn have two papers detailing
the full account of their formalization.)

In some sense, this is a misstatement of our achievements. The "Main
theorem" of our paper is just the icing on the cake, since there is no
other way to prove this result other than formalizing the machinery of
forcing, which is the real achievement of this paper. Han & van Doorn
[CPP 2020] hint that the formalization of forcing in set theoretical
foundations is practically impossible.

We would like to point out that we proved the fundamental theorems of
forcing, which are the main tools to work with the forcing relation.
