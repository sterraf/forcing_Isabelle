One of its most famous applications is the possibility to transform a topos into a boolean topos using the dense topology, which corresponds in essence to Gödel’s double negation translation. The same construction has not been developed in Martin-Löf type theory because of a mismatch between topos theory and type theory. This mismatched has been fixed recently by considering homotopy type theory, an extension of Martin-Löf type theory with new principles inspired by category theory and homotopy theory, and which corresponds closely to higher toposes. In this paper, we give a computer-checked construction of Lawvere-Tierney sheafification in homotopy type theory.},

We also formalize the satisfaction of the axioms of Extensionality, Foundation, Union, and Powerset. The axiom of Infinity is likewise treated, under additional assumptions on the ground model. In order to achieve these goals, we extended Paulson's library on constructibility with renaming of variables for internalized formulas, improved results on definitions by recursion on well-founded relations, and sharpened hypotheses in his development of relativization and absoluteness.}

formalization of a proof of the Feit-Thompson Odd Order Theorem in the Coq proof assistant.
The formalized proof is constructive, and relies on nothing but the axioms and rules
of the foundational framework implemented by Coq. To support the formalization, we
developed a comprehensive set of reusable libraries of formalized mathematics, including
results in finite group theory, linear algebra, Galois theory, and the theories of
the real and complex algebraic numbers.},

We formalised enough definitions and theorems in topology, algebra and geometry to define perfectoid spaces in the Lean theorem prover. This experiment confirms that a proof assistant can handle complexity in that direction, which is rather different from formalising a long proof about simple objects. It also confirms that mathematicians with no computer science training can become proficient users of a proof assistant in a relatively short period of time. Finally, we observe that formalising a piece of mathematics that is a trending topic boosts the visibility of proof assistants amongst pure mathematicians.},

Erd{\H{o}}s proved that the answer was yes if and only if the continuum hypothesis was false: an innocent-looking question turned out to be undecidable in the axioms of ZFC. The formalisation of these proofs in Isabelle/HOL demonstrate the combined use of complex analysis and set theory, and in particular how the Isabelle/HOL library for ZFC [17] integrates set theory with higher-order logic.",

abstract = {Combinatorial design theory studies set systems with certain balance and symmetry properties and has applications to computer science and elsewhere. This paper presents a modular approach to formalising designs for the first time using Isabelle and assesses the usability of a locale-centric approach to formalisations of mathematical structures. We demonstrate how locales can be used to specify numerous types of designs and their hierarchy. The resulting library, which is concise and adaptable, includes formal definitions and proofs for many key properties, operations, and theorems on the construction and existence of designs.},

The natural proof assistant {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbbm {\{}N{\}}{\$}{\$}Naproche accepts input texts in the mathematical controlled natural language ForTheL. Some ForTheL texts that proof-check in {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbbm {\{}N{\}}{\$}{\$}Naproche come close to ordinary mathematical writing. The formalization examples demonstrate the potential to write mathematics in a natural yet completely formal language and to delegate tedious organisatorial details and obvious proof steps to strong automated theorem proving so that mathematical ideas and the ``beauty'' of proofs become visible.",
