To the best of our knowledge, all of the previous works in
formalization of the method 
of forcing have been done in different variants of type theory, and
none of them uses the ctm approach. The
most important is the recent one by 
Han and van Doorn
\cite{han_et_al:LIPIcs:2019:11074,DBLP:conf/cpp/HanD20}, which includes
a formalization of the independence of $\CH$ by means
the Boolean-valued approach to forcing, using the Lean
proof assistant \cite{DBLP:conf/cade/MouraKADR15}.
