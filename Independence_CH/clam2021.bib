abstract = "An abstract definition of bisimulation is presented. It makes possible a uniform definition of bisimulation across a range of different models for parallel computation presented as categories. As examples, transition systems, synchronisation trees, transition systems with independence (an abstraction from Petri nets), and labelled event structures are considered. On transition systems the abstract definition readily specialises to Milner's strong bisimulation. On event structures it explains and leads to a strengthening of the history-preserving bisimulation of Rabinovitch and Traktenbrot and van Glabeek and Goltz. A tie-up with open maps in a (pre)topos, as they appear in the work of Joyal and Moerdijk, brings to light a new model, presheaves on categories of pomsets, into which the usual category of labelled event structures embeds fully and faithfully. As an indication of its promise, this new presheaf model has “refinement” operators. The general approach yields a logic, generalising Hennessy–Milner logic, which is characteristic for the generalised notion of bisimulation."

 abstract = {Motivated by problems in certain areas of analysis, like measure theory and harmonic analysis, where σ-ideals of compact sets are encountered very often as notions of small or exceptional sets, we undertake in this paper a descriptive set theoretic study of σ-ideals of compact sets in compact metrizable spaces. In the first part we study the complexity of such ideals, showing that the structural condition of being a σ-ideal imposes severe definability restrictions. A typical instance is the dichotomy theorem, which states that σ-ideals which are analytic or coanalytic must be actually either complete coanalytic or else Gδ. In the second part we discuss (generators or as we call them here) bases for σ-ideals and in particular the problem of existence of Borel bases for coanalytic non-Borel σ-ideals. We derive here a criterion for the nonexistence of such bases which has several applications. Finally in the third part we develop the connections of the definability properties of σ-ideals with other structural properties, like the countable chain condition, etc.},

For example, we prove that for an analytic ideal I, either the ideal {X ⊂ (Ω × Ω: ⊂En X ⊂({0, 1,…,n} × Ω } is Rudin-Keisler below I, or I is very simply induced by a lower semicontinuous submeasure. Also, we show that the class of ideals induced in this manner by lsc submeasures coincides with Polishable ideals as well as analytic P-ideals. We study this class of ideals and characterize, for example, when the ideals in it are Fσ or when they carry a locally compact group topology. We apply these results to Borel partial orders to rederive a theorem of Todorcevic and to Borel equivalence relations to answer a question of Kechris and Louveau. As another application we give a characterization of σ-ideals of μ-zero sets for Maharam submeasures μ on the Cantor set which is to a large extent analogous to a characterization of the meager ideal due to Kechris and the author."

One of its most famous applications is the possibility to transform a topos into a boolean topos using the dense topology, which corresponds in essence to Gödel’s double negation translation. The same construction has not been developed in Martin-Löf type theory because of a mismatch between topos theory and type theory. This mismatched has been fixed recently by considering homotopy type theory, an extension of Martin-Löf type theory with new principles inspired by category theory and homotopy theory, and which corresponds closely to higher toposes. In this paper, we give a computer-checked construction of Lawvere-Tierney sheafification in homotopy type theory.},

     abstract = {We mechanize, in the proof assistant Isabelle, a proof of the axiom-scheme of Separation in generic extensions of models of set theory by using the fundamental theorems of forcing. We also formalize the satisfaction of the axioms of Extensionality, Foundation, Union, and Powerset. The axiom of Infinity is likewise treated, under additional assumptions on the ground model. In order to achieve these goals, we extended Paulson's library on constructibility with renaming of variables for internalized formulas, improved results on definitions by recursion on well-founded relations, and sharpened hypotheses in his development of relativization and absoluteness.}

These operations constitute a meta-logic (or 'logical framework') in which the object-logics are formalized. Isabelle is now based on higher-order logic-a precise and well-understood foundation.},
