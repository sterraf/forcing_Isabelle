User manual for relativization
==============================

The relativization of a term/formula consists in changing every quantifier
into a bounded quantifier, where the bound is a class. In Isabelle/ZF 
relativization can be thought as a term/formula transformer mapping terms
of type "a" to terms of type "[i\<Rightarrow>o] \<Rightarrow> a" (where "a" is "i" for terms
and "o" for formulas).

The theory Relativization implements a simple algorithm to relativize terms.
Since Isabelle/ZF has constants, the algorithm uses a database that indicates
which relativized term corresponds to a given absolute term. 

The following commands are defined:
- relativize name new_name: introduces a new definition "new_name_def" whose
    definiens is the relativization of the term named "name" and adds the entry
    ("name","new_name") to the database.
- relativize_tm term name: introduces a new definition "name_def" whose 
    definiens is the relativization of "term".
- reldb_add abs_term rel_term: adds an entry to the database. 

There are two attributes defined:
- absolut: corresponds to a named theorems called "Absoluteness", this is used
    to keep track of all the absoluteness results. In Relativization we pack
    most of the absoluteness results proved in ZF-Constructible.
- Rel: only useful in theorems proving an absoluteness theorem whose conclusion
    is exactly of the form "is_term(A,v_1,\<dots>,v_n,z) \<longleftrightarrow> z = term(tm_1,\<dots>,tm_n)".
    In that case it adds the entry (term,is_term) to the database.

Some notes:
- We don't use the abbreviated relativized concepts for 1,2,3.
- When relativizing bool_of_o, Collect, and Replace we relativize the formula.

To Do
-----

1. Fix the broken attribute (issue 0).
2. Fix the relativization in contexts (issue 1).
3. Consider the cases described in (issue 3).
4. The relativization of terms with the command relativize does not add 
  the pair (abs,rel) to the database when the command is outside a locale
  context.
5. Check if the relativization of collects should relativize the predicate.
6. Test the handling of bool_of_o, Collect, and Replace: we relativize 
  the formula, is that correct?
7. We could use relativ_fm or relativ_tm by inspecting the type in the 
  recursive calls.
8. The command relativize does not handle qualified names.
 
Issues
------

0. The attribute Rel breaks at least the TC attribute. The situation arises 
  when the attribute is used in a lemma declared in a context; all the 
  subsequent lemmas in that context warns about duplication of rules.
1. The relativization commands are fragile when used in contexts. This needs to
  better understood.
2. The command relativize_tm repeats variables names.
3. There are some concepts that cannot be relativized. We group them in
  the following classes (the statements are taken from the ZF-Constructible
  library):


a. Very peculiar:
"M(a) ==> successor_ordinal(M,a) \<longleftrightarrow> Ord(a) & (\<exists>b[M]. a = succ(b))"

b. Peculiar, but perhaps manageable:
"M(a) ==> finite_ordinal(M,a) \<longleftrightarrow> a \<in> nat"
"[| M(A); M(f) |] ==> injection(M,A,B,f) \<longleftrightarrow> f \<in> inj(A,B)"
"[| M(A); M(B); M(f) |] ==> surjection(M,A,B,f) \<longleftrightarrow> f \<in> surj(A,B)"
"[| M(A); M(B); M(f) |] ==> bijection(M,A,B,f) \<longleftrightarrow> f \<in> bij(A,B)"
"[| M(A); M(f) |] ==> typed_function(M,A,B,f) \<longleftrightarrow> f \<in> A -> B", 

(* For formulas like "t\<in>nat", we don't handle this yet. *)
