Forcing in Isabelle/ZF
======= == ===========

The source theory files are located in two directories:

    * 'Constructible' contains our version of 
    Paulson's constructibility library;

    * 'src' contains the material directly concerning 
    forcing.

The directory 'html' contains a browseable and cross-linked
version of the sources.

------------------------------------------------------------

Building the session
======== === =======

To build the session, change to 'src'
and run

make build

To obtain also an HTML version of the sources, do

make html

To make a tar, run

make tar

------------------------------------------------------------

System requirements
====== ============

At least 8G of RAM would be desirable. The ML process is ran 
with a minimum heap size of 5.5G. If memory requirements are 
not met, there is a chance that the building process stalls 
indefinitely at some point, without failing.
